Theme Park Attraction Visits
==================================================================

Dataset Information: 
This dataset comprises a set of users and their visits to various attractions in five theme parks (Disneyland, Epcot, California Adventure, Disney Hollywood and Magic Kindgom). The user-attraction visits are determined based on geo-tagged Flickr photos that are: (i) posted from Aug 2007 to Aug 2017 and retrieved using the Flickr API; (ii) then mapped to specific attraction location and attraction categories; and (iii) then grouped into individual travel sequences (consecutive user-attraction visits that differ by <8hrs).  Other associated datasets are the "List of Attractions/POIs" dataset ("POI-{themeParkName}.csv" files from "poiList-sigir17.zip") and "Attraction/POI Cost-Profit Table" dataset ("costProfCat-{themeParkName}POI-all.csv" files from "costProf-sigir17.zip").

All user-attraction visits in each theme park are stored in a single csv file that contains the following columns/fields:
 - photoID: identifier of the photo based on Flickr.
 - userID: identifier of the user based on Flickr.
 - dateTaken: the date/time that the photo was taken (unix timestamp format).
 - poiID: identifier of the attraction (Flickr photos are mapped to attraction based on their lat/long).
 - poiTheme: category of the attraction (e.g., Roller Coaster, Family, Water, etc).
 - poiFreq: number of times this attraction has been visited.
 - rideDuration: the normal ride duration of this attraction.
 - seqID: travel sequence no. (consecutive attraction visits by the same user that differ by <8hrs are grouped as one travel sequence).
