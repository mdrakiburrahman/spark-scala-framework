Dataset Information: 
This dataset comprises various attractions/points-of-interest (POI) that are found in each of the five theme parks (Disneyland, Epcot, California Adventure, Disney
Hollywood and Magic Kindgom), along with information such as the POI name, lat/lon coordinates and theme (category). This dataset is used to derive the "Attraction/POI Cost-Profit Table" dataset ("costProfCat-{themeParkName}POI-all.csv" files from "costProf-sigir17.zip") and "Theme Park Attraction Visits Dataset" dataset ("userVisits-{themeParkName}.csv" files from "userVisits-sigir17.zip")

File Description:
There are a total of five files, each named "POI-{themeParkName}.csv", where each row indicate a specific POI and its associated ID, name, lat/long and theme.

The list of POI for each theme park is stored in a single csv file that contains the following columns/fields:
 - poiID: ID of the attraction/POI
 - poiName: name of the attraction/POI
 - rideDuration: duration (minutes) to complete the attraction/ride.
 - lat: latitude coordinates
 - lon: longitude coordinates
 - theme: category of the attraction/POI (e.g., Roller Coaster, Family, Water, etc).
